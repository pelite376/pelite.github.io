### Problem and Solution Overview
Though gentrification is a nationwide phenomenon affecting many Americans, those affected feel unified only in their feelings of isolation and disempowerment in the wake of their changing neighborhoods. Beyond this, residents of gentrified areas also face another challenge: unlike in more wealthy neighborhoods, members of these communities lack the time and resources to inquire about (and potentially voice discontent for) businesses and residences that are being built, thereby waiving their power to support their own neighborhoods. Thus residents can do little but watch laundromats and other services crucial to their day-to-day activities seemingly disappear, in their place popping up expensive coffee shops and tech startups. 

Our design aims to raise awareness of this issue in a disruptive manner. We have selected for our design a large interactive display, to be placed in a public, central location within an urban gentrified community. The design itself will support some of our most ambitious tasks, namely the ability to track the history and development of buildings within the community and the ability to geotag art and other personal ideas to buildings and locations. Although such a design is likely too ambitious and non-profitable to receive real-world funding, we have chosen this design because it is by far the most eye-catching, and we believe it is an idea that could prove to be immensely impactful while synergizing the selected tasks. Additionally, it is not something that requires much effort on the part of the gentrified to still create a powerful statement.

### Design Research: Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants
Because our topic is not one as conducive to contextual inquiries, our [research](https://pelite376.github.io/ciReview/) involved conducting a semi-structured interview of the director of the Center for Learning in Action (CLiA), as well as guided storytelling with two college students and one middle-aged adult, each of whom had experienced gentrification firsthand. Our goal was to understand the problems faced by people experiencing gentrification by coming as close as possible to stepping in their shoes. The only criterion for the guided storytelling was that the individuals had experienced gentrification firsthand, and we believed this method the most effective because it allowed us to ask closely about people's real experiences in gentrification while allowing the conversation to flow in whichever direction our participants felt important to reflect upon.

### Design Research: Themes
As we were gathering our data from our [research](https://pelite376.github.io/ciReview/), we found a few issues that were common throughout all of our participants. These issues include unawareness of resources, feelings of isolation and disempowerment, and unawareness of what's coming before it's too late. While there are many means by which we could try to tackle these disparate issues, we thought it best to focus on one. By tackling the feelings of isolation that residents in gentrified communities feel, we hope to not only inspire a sense of community within these residents, but also to inform outsiders of the harm they may be doing to these residents by invading their communities. 

### Task Analysis
Our design is intended for use by everyone possible, as the ultimate goal is to raise awareness in all individuals. Though not everyone may participate in actually creating the display, our aim is that everyone wishes to interact with the display and learn in the process. Even someone who does not physically interact with the display can hopefully gain even from simply looking at it and thereby learning about her community. In doing so, we are fostering the new task of allowing people to track the history of buildings and better understanding the community. In creating an interactive display, we are also creating the new task of geotagging art to buildings, creating a connection between the physical community and oneself, showing others how much a community means to its current residents, regardless of how outsiders may themselves perceive it.
