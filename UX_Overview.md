### Problem and Solution Overview


### Design Research: Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants
Because our topic is not one as conducive to contextual inquiries, our [research](https://pelite376.github.io/ciReview/) involved conducting a semi-structured interview of (a person at CLiA, but what was her title again?), as well as guided storytelling with two college students and one middle-aged adult, each of whom had experienced gentrification firsthand. Our goal was to understand the problems faced by people experiencing gentrification by coming as close as possible to stepping in their shoes. The only criterion for the guided storytelling was that the individuals had experienced gentrification firsthand, and we believed this method the most effective because it allowed us to ask closely about people's real experiences in gentrification while allowing the conversation to flow in whichever direction our participants felt important to reflect upon.
