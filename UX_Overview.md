### Problem and Solution Overview
Though gentrification is a nationwide phenomenon affecting many Americans, those affected feel unified only in their feelings of isolation and disempowerment in the wake of their changing neighborhoods. Useful laundromats and other

### Design Research: Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants
Because our topic is not one as conducive to contextual inquiries, our [research](https://pelite376.github.io/ciReview/) involved conducting a semi-structured interview of the director of the Center for Learning in Action (CLiA), as well as guided storytelling with two college students and one middle-aged adult, each of whom had experienced gentrification firsthand. Our goal was to understand the problems faced by people experiencing gentrification by coming as close as possible to stepping in their shoes. The only criterion for the guided storytelling was that the individuals had experienced gentrification firsthand, and we believed this method the most effective because it allowed us to ask closely about people's real experiences in gentrification while allowing the conversation to flow in whichever direction our participants felt important to reflect upon.

### Design Research: Themes
As we were gathering our data from our [research](https://pelite376.github.io/ciReview/), we found a few issues that were common throughout all of our participants. These issues include unawareness of resources, feelings of isolation and disempowerment, and unawareness of what's coming before it's too late. While there are many means by which we could try to tackle these disparate issues, we thought it best to focus on one. By tackling the feelings of isolation that residents in gentrified communities feel, we hope to not only inspire a sense of community within these residents, but also to inform outsiders of the harm they may be doing to these residents by invading their communities. 

### Task Analysis
Our design is intended for use by everyone possible, as the ultimate goal is to raise awareness in all individuals.
