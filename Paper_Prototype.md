## Paper Prototypes

# Overview:

Here is an overview of our entire paper prototype:

(This is where that image goes)

Using the interface: 
Upon walking up to the interface, one is greeted by a sample home screen as shown below. This home screen has a few simple icons depicting what can be done, and each can be touched to learn more about them.

(This is where the image of the blank home screen goes)

# Task 1: Geotagging art to the building
After pressing the green plus sign, users are greeted with options to upload photos to their canvas (via AirDrop or something similar), select colors and draw, and write text. These can be combined into one image. Once the user walks away, their image increases in size and is uploaded to the building for all to see.

(This is where the image(s) of the art section go)

# Task 2: Connecting people to local politicans
Upon tapping the "politician" icon, users see the array of all of their local politicians. Pressing the "i" next to any of their images pulls up additional information (phone number, email, etc.).

(This is where the politician stuff goes)

# Additional task: flagging others' content (to prevent hate speech and other bad things)
Users can press the flag, which allows them to select an image and flag it for various reasons. These inputs are processed, and if the request is valid, the post will get removed.
