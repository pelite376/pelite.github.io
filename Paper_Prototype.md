# Overview:

Here is an overview of our entire paper prototype:

(This is where that image goes)

# Using the interface: 
People walking on the street will notice that a building that has been recently gentrified appears to look like its past self, before the gentrification. They may be intrigued by the various pieces of passionate art that are also shown on this display. Upon walking up to the interface, users understand that the entire interface is a touch screen and are greeted by a sample home screen as shown below. This home screen has a few simple icons depicting what can be done, and each can be touched to learn more about them.

# Task 1: Geotagging art to the building
After pressing the green plus sign, users are greeted with options to upload photos to their canvas (via AirDrop or something similar), select colors and draw, and write text. In the write section, users have the option to select text color, font, and size. In the draw section, users have the option to select color and pen size. In the photo section, users have the option to submit their own photos as part of the collage, or as the entire post (as these photos' sizes can be changed). These can all be combined into one image. Once the user walks away, their image magnifies and self-uploads to the building for all to see.

# Task 2: Connecting people to local politicans
Upon tapping the "politician" icon, users see the array of all of their local politicians. In this screen, users only see the faces, names, and titles of each of these individuals, but pressing the "i" next to any of their images pulls up additional information (phone number, email, etc.). This information is meant for users to contact politicians on their own terms if they feel strongly and wish to speak to them. 

(This is where the politician stuff goes)

# Additional task: flagging others' content (to prevent hate speech and other bad things)
Users can press the flag, which allows them to select an image and flag it for various reasons. These inputs are processed, and if the request is valid, the post will get removed.
