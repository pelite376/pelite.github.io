##Task Analysis

_Who is going to use the design?_ Our design is intended for use by the residents of neighborhoods that are at risk of experiencing gentrification. This includes people of all ages, so long as they feel that they belong to the existing community and want to get involved.

_What tasks do they now perform?_ This is the biggest issue at hand, because currently people who are living in gentrified areas have virtually no way of fighting gentrification given their resources and availability. As a result, they do not perform any tasks beyond watching residences and businesses get torn down and replaced overnight.

_What tasks are desired?_ The goal of commUnity is to provide people with more community awareness, so that they can more effectively learn about and support their local communities. This allows users to strengthen their communities from within, potentially even helping to enrich the preexisting culture and sense of community by allowing users to learn about local community favorites that they hadnâ€™t heard of before.

_How are the tasks learned?_ There are many ways that people learn about local businesses and events, the most common of which is word-of mouth or firsthand experience, but there can be many other ways that locals can learn about and get involved with their community. This includes everything from flyers on the street to advertisements, but these are usually paid for by larger businesses.

_Where are the tasks performed?_ Anyone can support a local business simply by walking in the store and buying something, or by spreading positive word-of-mouth and encouraging others to do so when they are able.

_What is the relationship between the person and data?_ For people supporting their local communities, the relationship can be very personal. People can have very close ties to their local laundromats, corner stores, and other locations if they are places that these people visit for their entire lives. 

_What other tools does the person have?_ Other tools to learn about surrounding businesses include Yelp, online search, word-of-mouth, flyers seen on the street, and firsthand experience walking by a local business. These are all means by which people can learn about businesses in their surrounding area, but none of these methods are as optimized specifically for supporting businesses that are struggling or could benefit from greater community involvement as is commUnity.

_How do people communicate with each other?_ Businesses may communicate with locals by posting specials and messages, as well as sharing their location, and locals may communicate with others by sharing their positive experiences with their favorite places. The result is that these places gain the business they need and all are more well-informed.

_How often are the tasks performed?_ People may use commUnity as often, or not, as they wish. Living in a low-income neighborhood means people do not always have the time to help others, but if they are looking for a quick bite to eat or maybe a local discount, they can check commUnity to see if anything is available.

_What are the time constraints on the tasks?_ There is effectively no time constraint, other than businesses wanting to post discounts or specials only for finite periods. Otherwise, a business is free to use commUnity so long as it exists.
What happens when things go wrong? It may be difficult to ensure that the businesses using this platform are of the appropriate size and that they are doing so for the appropriate reasons. To prevent this, commUnity will keep moderators to ensure that only local businesses are using the service to promote themselves, and that all comments and posts are appropriate to the topic. Eventually, communities that adopt the service would come to appreciate the service enough that the community can support itself in this respect.
