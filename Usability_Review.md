# Usability Test Results

## Usability Test 1
Discuss your three usability tests. Provide a description of each test, including the participant, the environment, why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol, and the roles of each team member who participated in the test. Briefly discuss revisions you made in your process and prototype over the course of your testing.
Present a table or list of results from your three usability tests. For each critical incident, include:
  An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.
  For negative incidents, the severity of the issue assigned by the team.
  For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.

# Final Paper Prototype

Submit detailed images of your final paper prototype, as revised in this process. Include both:
  An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
  Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

# Our Most Critical Issues:

A common theme among our most salient modifications was that of optimizing functionality. We felt that each of these issues greatly limited the potential usability of our product by confusing the user into thinking there isn't any more to do.

## Issue 1: Illegible Buttons
Each of our users struggled, to some degree, with understanding the functionality of each button. Though our original goal was to create a design that felt seamless and minimalistic, the result ended up being a confusing display that slowed productivity. Especially because this is not an interface that is already well-integrated into society, we think it's important that we forego the sleeker design for something that helps guide users through the process. The end result, however, is still something that is fairly minimalistic, as there are only a few buttons with which the users can interact anyways. We hope that implementing this change will make our design something that does not confuse our users as much.

## Issue 2: Unintuitive Workflow
Many of our users elected to first press the politician button (as it was near the top of the screen) before pressing any of the buttons that dealt with content. The users felt confused by what they could do with this information; many tried to tap on the phone numbers, email icons, etc., all to no avail. What's worse, once they figured out they couldn't do anything else on this display, they thought they were done. We've elected to still provide this information, but we wanted to hide it under a brief description of the button's purpose. Once again, we feel it is more important that users understand what they can do, than it is to have the sleekest possible display. We found this issue especially important because the users' first impression of functionality affects whether they may proceed to use our product. If the first thing they stumble upon is a bunch of politician information with no context, they may feel that our product is an information dump, feel bored, and leave. We want users to only access this information if it is something that interests them, which is why we've hidden it under a new "information" button, allowing the focus of the display to be on creating content.

## Issue 3: Adding Multiple Types of Art
Many of our users felt ready to post content after adding only one type of media (only a photo, drawing, or block of text). While it's possible that the content they posted was all they had intended to post, after discussing with them we realized that there was a different issue: they did not know that different types of content can be mixed onto a single post. We thought this was a significant issue because it means users feel extremely limited in the scope of their posts, and this means that users would use our product without ever exploiting its full functionality. Rather, they would go about posting mediocre content that would not be as effective. For this reason, we have tried to make it very clear that users can mix content types by keeping all three buttons on the navigation bar until users post. No longer will they need to press the "+" every time they wish to add another element. Instead, they can freely switch between content types and post when they are done.
