title: Usability Testing Review
---

Present the results of your usability testing and your final paper prototype:

Discuss your three usability tests. Provide a description of each test, including the participant, the environment, why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol, and the roles of each team member who participated in the test. Briefly discuss revisions you made in your process and prototype over the course of your testing.
Present a table or list of results from your three usability tests. For each critical incident, include:
  An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.
  For negative incidents, the severity of the issue assigned by the team.
  For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.

Submit detailed images of your final paper prototype, as revised in this process. Include both:
  An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
  Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

Discuss two to four revisions that you consider to be the most salient and important modifications to your paper prototype based on issues identified in inspection, usability testing, or critique. 
These issues may already be included in the above list, but discuss them in more detail and argue why detecting and fixing them is important to your design.
