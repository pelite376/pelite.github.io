## Problem and Solution Overview
(1 paragraph) A concise statement of the problem you are tackling and a brief synopsis of your proposed solution. Consider updating this from your previous report to reflect the scope of your final design.

## Initial Paper Prototype
(1 paragraph) Present your original paper prototype, as a baseline against which this report will present your iteration. Convey the critical aspects of your design, including your two primary tasks.

## Testing Process
(1 paragraph) Present your testing process, including your method and your participants. This process probably evolved some in the course of your project. Include a retrospective on how you refined your process, separate from how you refined your design.

## Testing Results
(1 paragraph) Summarize the results of your paper prototype testing and refinement. Present what you learned about each version of your prototype and what changes you made as a result. This will include changes from your heuristic evaluation, usability testing, and design critique.

## Final Paper Prototype
(1 paragraph) Present your final version of your paper prototype, as you did for your initial paper prototype above. Convey the critical aspects of your design, including your two primary tasks.

## Digital Mockup
(1 paragraph) Present your digital mockup. Convey the critical aspects of your design, including your two primary tasks. Briefly discuss any changes you needed to make as you switched to your digital tools instead of paper. Briefly discuss any changes you made in response to critique. Include descriptions of how your design supports each of your primary tasks (e.g., one paragraph per task).
