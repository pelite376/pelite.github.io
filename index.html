<h1><font color="0489E5">How do you feel about your housing community?</font>
</h1>
<p> 
  Many people described a barrier in the housing process due to the lack of communication with administration, facilities, and others in their housing 
  community. While there are spaces across campus for gatherings that can better the residential experience, 
  they are often underutilized and under promoted. After speaking to students at Williams College, we noticed common 
  themes were centered around the fact that housing logistics and information 
  were difficult for all these students to deal with because of poor communication, 
  and also that there were no social spaces within their housing 
  communities due to barriers for creating these spaces.

<h1> Let's Send Out Events! </h1>
<p> The goal of RES is to increase knowledge of these events throughout a college campus to connect 
  individuals within a housing community, and allow them to learn more about their living environments. 
  People can share events they are hosting and therefore notify others within that quad or neighborhood; 
  facilities and housing authorities will also have access to the application and therefore be informed of 
  these events as well.

<h1> Our Design Process </h1>
We used an iterative design process to refine the details of our final design. After understanding the problem, we
conducted <a href="https://hci-res.github.io/2019-10-05-CI-Review/">contextual inquiries</a> and <a href="https://hci-res.github.io/2019-10-06-Task-Review/">
  analyzed tasks</a>
to become more familiar with the problem and user demographics. Using the feedback from our tests, we went through many paper prototypes before creating
our final design. </p> 
<p> Our design went through multiple changes because our original prototypes did not 
provide an inuititve interface for our users. This final design was made possible because we experimented with <a href="https://hci-res.github.io/2019-10-30-Paper-Prototype/">low-fidelity paper prototyping </a>. </p>
