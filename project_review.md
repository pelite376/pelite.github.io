## Our Design:
  We have selected for our design a large interactive display, to be placed in a public, central location within an urban gentrified community. The design itself will support some of our most ambitious 
s, namely the ability to (task 4) track the history and development of buildings within the community and the ability to (task 6) geotag art and other personal ideas to buildings and locations. Although such a design is likely too ambitious and non-profitable to receive real-world funding, we have chosen this design because it is by far the most eye-catching, and we believe it is an idea that could prove to be immensely impactful while synergizing the selected tasks.
  Residents of gentrified areas are usually people who are low-income with little time or energy to be activists. Additionally, they have little knowledge of the happenings and history of their own communities. By bringing the design to the people (rather than hoping they download an app or go looking for a service), we are catching their attention on their daily commutes. By encouraging members of the community to share their personal art and history with local buildings and businesses, we are making the community more personal to each individual while also allowing them to learn even more about it.
    We have chosen both of the above tasks to fit with an overarching theme of personalizing the subject of community. An interactive display, available to people who would walk by it every day or the occasional outsider, allows people within the community to show what it means to them, while people outside the community may learn about its rich history and culture. Community residents have a chance to show the outside what they are experiencing, beyond what can be found in Google searches and word-of-mouth.
