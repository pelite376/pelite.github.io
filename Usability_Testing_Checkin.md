## Our First Usability Test

Our first test featured two individuals who knew each other beforehand. We thought this would be the best method for our first usability test because, before the first test, it is most likley that there will be issues, and we think that any minor issues with a single person's understanding of the product could be mitigated by the other person, and vice versa. We also think that a group of two, lingering around in a public area, is the most likley group to use our product, as a single person is probably walking outside because they have somewhere to be, but a group of two may be simply strolling around, etc., and decide to stop by and use our product. 

Our protocol included first presenting our group with a scenario: they are walking on the street, and out of the corner of their eye, they spot a massive touch screen, projected onto a building, and they are interested in it, so they walk up to it. Beyond this, we let our users walk up to the display and begin interacting with it. We found it fitting to not present to them any goals of what they should be trying to do, because we found this situation more realistic––because this technology would exist, no one would instinctively know to walk up to it and begin posting art. Thus, our test also encompassed ensuring our users are able to self-discover all features of the product.

Our Computer was Liv, our Facilitator was Peter, and our Notetaker was Teiheim. Our posters presented a few issues: for one, they didn't know how to select a different style of paintbrush and font, because these selectors disappeared, so our new design will feature them as permanent elements of the display. Also, the users didn't know whether "AirDrop to: ..." meant they were adding or receiving a photo from their camera roll, so we should make this information more explicit. Lastly, one of our users confused the red flag for a "help" button, so we will create a new button making its function of flagging content more explicit.

Below are all of our heuristic evaluations.

The following are evaluations written by Phoebe and Michaela, conducted by Liv:

| Heuristic Broken | Description | Severity |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 3 | not clear how to save work, also an option to discard would be helpful | 3 |
| 1 | Seems like there should be a way to engage with the politician page | 1 |
| 1 | feedback on what happens after flagging content | 2 |
| 4 | consistency on meaning of the "x"- when adding content it saves/pushes, when on other content it goes back | 4 |
| 1 | when your post is added to the building, it might not be clear where it goes. Maybe content highlighting & a message would help | 3 |
| 3 | save/done buttons for "art" creation | 2 |
| 3 | choosing where art piece goes | 2 |
| 6 | blowing up images of art to look at more closely/report | 2 |
| 3 | choosing "wrong" order of buttons | 1 |
| 1 | confirming that "art" has been saved, report submitted | 2 |

Here is the evaluation writted by Eric, conducted by Peter and Teiheim:

| Heuristic Broken | Description | Severity |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 2 | "Send me a message" on the politician board is not interactive | 1 |
| 4 | "+" has 2 rules, add to your board and add to display | 2 |
| 1 | When flagging a post, you don't know what is happening when the post is removed | 1 |

## Revisions: Cognitive Walkthrough

* "Send me a message" (on the politician page) appears to do something to users but does not do anything in our design. It is confusing for the viewer so we have replaced it. 

![Evals](/img/politicians.jpg)

* We have added an option to discard the message. It makes the design as a whole more cohesive and more intuitive to use.

![Evals](/img/discard.jpg)

* We decided to opt for a check-mark to confirm to users that their content has been posted.

![Evals](/img/post.jpg)

* “The post has been sent to Admin for review.” Has been added after flagging content. This information appears as a pop-up box, which can be closed.
 
 ![Evals](/img/flag.jpg)
 
* One miscommunication between facilitators and users regards where the posted content goes. We will be clearer in the future that the content is posted to the building by creating a mini-version of the content and pasting it to the wall next to our display.
 
* When the user is ready to post, they may press the new green check button, where they will be prompted with a message confirming their intent to post content.
 
* The X has been switched to a back button to allow for greater clarity.

Disclaimer: Some of the heuristic violations were due to the paper prototype not accurately representing the context of the project. For example, users felt like they wouldn't be able to see which posts they are flagging closely, when in reality these posts will be scaled to the size of a building, so they will be very visible and clear.


## Findings: First Usability Test (this part not done)

Present a table or list of results from your first **usability test.** For each critical incident, include:
* An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
* Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative.
* For negative incidents, the severity of the issue assigned by the team.
* For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.

### Painting/Typing Issues, Severity: 3

Users did not know how to change colors, pen sizes, or font styles after selecting their initial styles. We have changed the layout such that these elements are now permanent fixtures beside the original "screen."

**image of the fixed design layout goes here**

### Misunderstanding the "Photos" Section, Severity: 2

Users did not know whether the photo section was to be used for adding photos or taking photos, nor did they know whether they were supposed to send or receive a photo during the screen that says "AirDrop to: ..." We addressed this layout issue below:

### Misunderstanding Flag, Severity: 1

One of our users confused the red flag for a "help" button, so we will create a new button making its function of flagging content more explicit, as shown below:

## Our Plan Going Forward
Overall, we think that we gained a lot from watching two participants, both of whom know each other, use our design, as this reflects a likely scenario of who would actually use our product. This is not to say, however, that singletons would never also use our design. For this reason, we would be interested in conducting at least one usability test with only a single individual, rather than with a group, to see if that individual would use the product differently than would a group of two or more. Beyond this, we still think it is more likely that a group of people who know each other are more likely to use our product, so our third usability test will, once again, be with a group of users (likely two), to iron out any final issues in our design. Since our first usability test ran smoothly, we plan to keep the roles as they were–– Liv as Computer, Peter as Facilitator, and Teiheim as Notetaker, so that there are no issues on our end and the study can focus on issues with the product. As for new approaches, we plan to set up a camera beforehand to record our users using the design, as opposed to simply recording the voices of our participants, as we had the first time. While it was nice to record their voices, we think it may also be useful to watch them ineract with the product on a physical level as well.
