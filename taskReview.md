## Task Descriptions

#### Connecting people to their local politicians

paragraph

#### Businesses notify local residents of community events

Joseph is the owner of a local sandwich shop in Brooklyn, and he wants people in the area to know that he plans to offer 25% off sandwiches on Fridays to help bring in more business. He used to just post these discounts outside of his storefront window, but he’s frustrated because people need to be walking by his store for the signs to be effective. The owner of a small and struggling business, he can’t afford to pay for additional advertisements on the radio or billboards, but he wants a way for more people to know about the deals he is offering. 

#### Notifying people about when new bills are being considered

Petra is an activist living in Detroit. She wants to be more involved in stopping gentrification in her community, but it feels like once she finds out about things, it’s always too late. She wants to get notifications whenever new bills about rezoning laws hit the desks of local politicians so she can begin taking action before they can be passed into law. Being able to see who is proposing what laws, and keep track of the voting history of different politicians allows her to be a more informed voter and to better advocate for the interests of her and her community.

#### Tracking the history/development of buildings

paragraph

#### Informing community residents of government programs available in the area

Piper is the owner of a local authentic Hawaiian barbecue restaurant in Queens, and she has been having difficulty paying her business’s bills on time due to rapidly increasing rent. She doesn’t believe that there are any government programs available to help her manage her rent bills, so she feels helpless and is considering closing the business. She tried looking online for anything she could find, but her busy schedule and long hours don’t allow her to spend a lot of time scouring legislative bills for information. She feels sad about closing down because she’s built a loyal customer base, some of which is almost 25 years old, but even this loyalty isn’t enough to get her through these hard times. She wishes there were a way she could quickly find out whether there exist programs she could leverage to get her through to better days.

#### Geotagging art and ideas to local businesses

Gabriel is a writer living in Los Angeles. He likes to write poems and short stories about the places he visits everyday, to educate people about the importance of these businesses to him and his community. With gentrification a growing threat in his neighbourhood, he wants to spread his works with more people by posting them online. Each piece is geotagged to the business that inspired it, and even if these businesses are eventually pushed out, the building will still carry the significance it once held to the community.
