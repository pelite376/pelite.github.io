### Task Descriptions

paragraph about task 1

paragraph abut task 2

Petra is an activist living in Detroit. She wants to be more involved in stopping gentrification in her community, but it feels like once she finds out about things, itâ€™s always too late. She wants to get notifications whenever new bills about rezoning laws hit the desks of local politicians so she can begin taking action before they can be passed into law. Being able to see who is proposing what laws, and keep track of the voting history of different politicians allows her to be a more informed voter and to better advocate for the interests of her and her community.

paragraph about task 4

paragraph about task 5

Gabriel is a writer living in Los Angeles. He likes to write poems and short stories about the places he visits everyday, to educate people about the importance of these businesses to him and his community. With gentrification a growing threat in his neighbourhood, he wants to spread his works with more people by posting them online. Each piece is geotagged to the business that inspired it, and even if these businesses are eventually pushed out, the building will still carry the significance it once held to the community.
