The main stakeholders in our design would be people living in low-income neighborhoods that are undergoing the process of gentrification, but anyone wanting to know more about their community could get involved. Potential candidates for our contextual inquiry, Professors of, and members of the Center for Learning in Action (CLiA). [Insert info on Joy James.] We feel like the volunteers and employees at CLiA might have some form of expertise on this subject, as much of their work revolves around community outreach. While we aren’t sure who, specifically, we’d like to be in touch with, we feel like it might be useful to shadow a program with similar goals to ours if one exists.

The contextual inquiries with CLiA employees could take place in their offices or in the field, depending on who we are able to meet with and what they would feel comfortable doing. If the meeting were to happen in an office space, we might ask them to walk us through the process of engaging in various community outreach programs, asking questions where appropriate throughout. If we are able to we can shadow someone working in a program that addresses the same kinds of problems we are trying to address.
