| Heuristic Broken | Description | Severity |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 2 | "Send me a message" on the politician board is not interactive | 1 |
| 4 | "+" has 2 rules, add to your board and add to display | 2 |
| 1 | When flagging a post, you don't know what is happening when the post is removed | 1 |
| 3 | not clear how to save work, also an option to discard would be helpful | 3 |
| 1 | Seems like there should be a way to engage with the politician page | 1 |
| 1 | feedback on what happens after flagging content | 2 |
| 4 | consistency on meaning of the "x"- when adding content it saves/pushes, when on other content it goes back | 4 |
| 1 | when your post is added to the building, it might not be clear where it goes. Maybe content highlighting & a message would help | 3 |
