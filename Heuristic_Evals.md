Below are all of our heuristic evaluations.

The following are evaluations written by Phoebe and Michaela, conducted by Liv:

| Heuristic Broken | Description | Severity |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 3 | not clear how to save work, also an option to discard would be helpful | 3 |
| 1 | Seems like there should be a way to engage with the politician page | 1 |
| 1 | feedback on what happens after flagging content | 2 |
| 4 | consistency on meaning of the "x"- when adding content it saves/pushes, when on other content it goes back | 4 |
| 1 | when your post is added to the building, it might not be clear where it goes. Maybe content highlighting & a message would help | 3 |
| 3 | save/done buttons for "art" creation | 2 |
| 3 | choosing where art piece goes | 2 |
| 6 | blowing up images of art to look at more closely/report | 2 |
| 3 | choosing "wrong" order of buttons | 1 |
| 1 | confirming that "art" has been saved, report submitted | 2 |

Here is the evaluation writted by Eric, conducted by Peter and Teiheim:

| Heuristic Broken | Description | Severity |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 2 | "Send me a message" on the politician board is not interactive | 1 |
| 4 | "+" has 2 rules, add to your board and add to display | 2 |
| 1 | When flagging a post, you don't know what is happening when the post is removed | 1 |


* "Send me a message" (on the politician page) appears to do something to users but does not do anything in our design. It is confusing for the viewer so we have replaced it.

* We have added an option to discard the message. It makes the design as a whole more cohesive and more intuitive to use.

* We decided to opt for a check-mark to confirm to users that their content has been posted.

* “The post has been sent to Admin for review.” Has been added after flagging content. This information appears as a pop-up box, which can be closed.

* One miscommunication between facilitators and users regards where the posted content goes. We will be clearer in the future that the content is posted to the building by creating a mini-version of the content and pasting it to the wall next to our display.
 
* When the user is ready to post, they may press the new green check button, where they will be prompted with a message confirming their intent to post content.
 
* The X has been switched to a back button to allow for greater clarity. 
 
Disclaimer: Some of the heuristic violations were due to the paper prototype not accurately representing the context of the project. For example, users felt like they wouldn't be able to see which posts they are flagging closely, when in reality these posts will be scaled to the size of a building, so they will be very visible and clear.
