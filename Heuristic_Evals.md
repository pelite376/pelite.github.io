title: Heuristic Evaluations
---

Below are all of our heuristic evaluations.

The following are evaluations written by Phoebe and Michaela, conducted by Liv:

| Heuristic Broken | Description | Severity |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 3 | not clear how to save work, also an option to discard would be helpful | 3 |
| 1 | Seems like there should be a way to engage with the politician page | 1 |
| 1 | feedback on what happens after flagging content | 2 |
| 4 | consistency on meaning of the "x"- when adding content it saves/pushes, when on other content it goes back | 4 |
| 1 | when your post is added to the building, it might not be clear where it goes. Maybe content highlighting & a message would help | 3 |
| 3 | save/done buttons for "art" creation | 2 |
| 3 | choosing where art piece goes | 2 |
| 6 | blowing up images of art to look at more closely/report | 2 |
| 3 | choosing "wrong" order of buttons | 1 |
| 1 | confirming that "art" has been saved, report submitted | 2 |

Here is the evaluation writted by Eric, conducted by Peter and Teiheim:

| Heuristic Broken | Description | Severity |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 2 | "Send me a message" on the politician board is not interactive | 1 |
| 4 | "+" has 2 rules, add to your board and add to display | 2 |
| 1 | When flagging a post, you don't know what is happening when the post is removed | 1 |


* Send me a message appears to do something to users but does not do anything in our design. It is confusing for the viewer so we have replaced it. 

* We have added an option to discard the message. It makes the design as a whole more cohesive and more intuitive to use. 

* It is ambiguous as to what content you have selected to flag. We decided to opt for a check-mark to show what has been flagged on a post.

* “The post has been sent to Admin for review.” Has been added after flagging content. It appears and then it fades out after a few seconds
 
* For our content we have added in our demonstration that when someone has added a post to the building the demonstrator will be post a piece of paper (the art) on top of the piece of paper with the building on it
 
* When the user has selected an element to post, the other posting buttons will disappear and a green check will appear at the bottom to allow them to submit that post. 
 
* The X has been switched for a back button to allow for greater clarity. 
 
* Some of the heuristic violations were due to the paper prototype not accurately representing the context of the project
